# Parazone 
The simplest way to browse the internet, download and open web pages and files anonymously. Only takes up 10KB of storage, and can be used to bypass parental restrictions such as Clever, Securely, and Apple's Screen Time. 

## Guide: 
- Open index.html.
- Paste link into Fetch and click the 'Fetch' button.
- Right click the link and select 'Save Link' or 'Download Linked File'.
- Copy the file directory, if it is a webpage (ends in '.html').
- Paste file directory into Open, and click the 'Open' button.

### List of webpages that work for search engine indexing (in substitute for Google, which doesn't work):

- Ecosia (URL: "https://ecosia.org/search?q=your+query+her")

I am sure there is more, these are the only two I know of that work with this project.
